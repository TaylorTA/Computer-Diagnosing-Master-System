# Computer-Diagnosing-Master-System
The domain of my expert system is troubleshooting in fixing computer. The system is simplified but covers most common software and hardware computer problems.

To run the system, type: 
	solve(fix_computer(Advice)).
And then answer a serial of questions. The system has different branches for different system issue (e.g. bios system, os system, etc.). Different ends may lead to same solution (Output 2 and Output 3) as one defective hardware component can have different symptoms.
